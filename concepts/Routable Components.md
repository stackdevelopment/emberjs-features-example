### Overview
Only eight colors that you need. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. We'll paint one happy little tree right here.

Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. There are no limits in this world. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around.

That's crazy. Take your time. Speed will come later. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. Son of a gun. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see.

It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? If you hypnotize it, it will go away. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. We need dark in order to show light. http://www.bobrosslipsum.com/
